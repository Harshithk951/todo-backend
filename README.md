This is the backend server for the Full-Stack To-Do Dashboard application. It is a secure RESTful API built with Node.js and Express. It is responsible for handling all business logic, user authentication, and database operations.

### üîå Live API Endpoint

The API is fully deployed on Render and is actively serving the live frontend application.

**Base URL:** **[https://todo-backend-api-vyp...onrender.com](https://todo-backend-api-vyp...onrender.com)**

---

### üèõÔ∏è Project Architecture

This API was designed as the central hub of the application, serving data to the frontend client and managing the database connection.

*   **This Backend (API)**: Built with Node.js/Express and deployed on **Render**.
*   **Frontend Client**: **[https://github.com/Harshithk951/To-Do-Full-Stack](https://github.com/Harshithk951/To-Do-Full-Stack)**

`[React Frontend on Vercel] <--- HTTPS Requests ---> [Node/Express API on Render] <--- SSL Connection ---> [MySQL Database on Aiven]`

---

### üîê Security & Core Architecture Features

*   **JWT-Based Authentication**: Implemented a robust authentication system using `jsonwebtoken`. The `/login` endpoint issues a token, which is then required in the `Authorization` header for all protected API routes.
*   **Password Security**: User passwords are never stored in plaintext. I used the `bcryptjs` library to hash and salt all passwords upon registration, and to compare hashes during login.
*   **CORS Policy**: The `cors` middleware is configured with a strict whitelist, ensuring that API requests are only accepted from the deployed frontend URL (`process.env.FRONTEND_URL`).
*   **Secure Database Connection**: The MySQL connection is configured with `ssl: { ca: fs.readFileSync('./ca.pem')... }` for a secure, encrypted link to the Aiven cloud database, preventing SSL handshake errors.
*   **Environment-Driven Configuration**: All sensitive values (database credentials, JWT secret, URLs) are managed via environment variables and loaded using `dotenv` in local development. This follows the twelve-factor app methodology.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Local Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Harshithk951/todo-backend.git
    cd todo-backend
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project. This is where you'll put your local database credentials and secrets.
    ```    # Database Connection
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_USER=root
    DB_PASSWORD=your_local_db_password
    DB_NAME=your_todo_database_name
    DB_PORT=3306

    # Security
    JWT_SECRET=a_very_long_and_secret_string_for_local_dev

    # CORS Configuration
    FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
    ```
4.  **Run the Server:**
    This will start the Express server, typically on port `3001`.
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
